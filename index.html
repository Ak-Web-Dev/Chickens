          <h2 id="chickens"><u>About Chickens</u></h2>
          <p>The chicken is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Text by wikipedia</a></p>

          <h2 id="native"><u>Native Chickens</u></h2>
          <p>Chickens have lived in rural villages throughout Africa and the Pacific for centuries and have adapted to the local environment and conditions. These village chickens are referred to as 'indigenous', 'native', 'local' or 'traditional' poultry and are easy to distinguish from standardised commercial or heritage breeds. <a href="https://kyeemafoundation.org/">Text by kyeemafoundation</a> </p>
          <p>With any luck and barring any genetic issues, These chickens should live for 8-12 years, with some chickens being reported to have lived for 15-20 years! <a href="https://www.fresheggsdaily.blog/">Text by Fresh eggs daily.blog</a></p>
          <p>Each hen will lay an average of 150 eggs annually. Only 75% or about 112 eggs from each hen will be allowed to hatch from which 95% or about 106 will reach market.</p>
          <p>Native chickens should be provided with ample housing structures where they can roost during the night, find shelter during rainy weather, and build nests when they are of laying age. Provide adequate range type housing for growers and breeders with 1-2 square meters per bird. <a href="https://mb.com.ph/">Text by Manila Bulettin</a> </p>
          <p>Despite the popularity of broiler chicken in urban or urbanizing areas, native chicken remains a preferred alternative meat because of its eating quality (distinctively savory, lean and finely textured meat) and health benefits despite its premium price. <a href="https://www.da.gov.ph/">Text by Department of Agriculture</a> </p>
